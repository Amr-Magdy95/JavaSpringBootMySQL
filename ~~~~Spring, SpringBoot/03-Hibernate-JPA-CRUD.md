- Just a reminder there're three layers here
  - Spring JDBC
  - Spring Data JDBC
  - JPA with vendor implementation
- Hibernate is a framework for saving java objects into a db.
- Hibernate minimizes the amount of JDBC code you have to develop
- Provides ORM --> mapping java classes to database tables
- JPA is Jakarta Persistence API
  - Standard API for ORM
  - It's a specification that defines a standard way to manage relational data in Java applications.
  - Only a specification
  - At its core, JPA is an ORM tool. It acts as a bridge between the object-oriented world of your Java code and the relational world of databases. This lets you work with data using Java objects that represent your real-world entities, instead of writing complex SQL statements.
  - JPA relies on an ORM provider (like Hibernate or EclipseLink) to implement its specifications.
  - These providers take care of:
    - Mapping Java classes to database tables
    - Translating object operations to database queries
  - Only a specification --> defines a set of interfaces and requires an implementation to be usable.
    - Hibernate provides implementation for said interfaces, so does eclipselink

  - https://hibernate.org/orm/documentation/6.5/
  - entity manager is a special jpa helper object
  - TypedQuery<Student> theQuery = entityManager.createQuery("from Student", Student.class)
- The relationship between Hibernate/JPA and JDBC
  - Hibernate/JPA uses JDBC for all DB communication; Hibernate/JPA is just another layer on top of JDBC
